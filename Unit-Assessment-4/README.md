# NoDB Project - Cheefa's Fried Pies Landing Site

## Description
- This is the first big project that I worked on while a student at DevMountain
- I built this project from scratch. We were not given any instructions or walkthrough.
- This project is a landing site for a small bakery. 

## Pre planning Stage
- I used WireframePro.com to make an outline of what I wanted the website to look like.
